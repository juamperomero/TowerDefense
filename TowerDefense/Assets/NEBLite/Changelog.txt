WHAT'S NEW IN NEBLite VERSION 1.2.2 - (2024/01/25)
- Nothing much. Just a minor rename from NEBToolUtilities to NEBLiteUtilities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEBLite VERSION 1.2.1
- Added new tool: Blendshape Creator
  This tool allows you to create blendshapes from slight variation of two models.
  There is also the Pro version in NEBPro that allows you to copy from multiple models at once.
  Tutorial on how to use this is available at https://www.youtube.com/@ReForgeMode

- Blendshape Transfer Advanced Mode
  By enabling advanced mode, you will be able to transfer blendshapes directly from SkinnedMeshRenderers.
  You can directly choose which body part you wanna transfer to: Face, Body, or Hair.

- Experimental: Colorful Debugger
  Blendshape Creator and Transfer will highlight the problematic item that you need to pay attention to.
  Let me know how do you feel about this. If succesful, this will be applied to all other tool.

- Minor Recode: Blendshape Organizer has been recoded to be more efficient.
